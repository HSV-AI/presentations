## Outline

Each day is 2 hour block. We will give everyone 5 minutes in cased of technical difficulties. We are also planning a 10 minute break in the middle.

### Day 1:

Introductions

Discussion on "What is AI"

The traditional practice of computer programming is that you write a program that tells a computer exactly what to do. The difference with AI is that you write a program that tells a computer how to learn from data or its environment and take action based on what it has learned.

Also - you may here different terms like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, etc. Here's a good diagram that shows the relationship of these fields:

There are also two different techniques that are used with AI that you may come across:
* Supervised Learning
* Unsupervised Learning
