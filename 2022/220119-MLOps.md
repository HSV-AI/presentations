# MLOps Definition

- Base Paper from Google - https://cloud.google.com/architecture/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning
- Coursera course by the authors of the paper, and Andrew Ng - https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-engineering-for-production-mlops
- "Gentle Introduction to MLOPs" - or as I would call it: "Plagarism of the Google Paper, but with better graphics": https://towardsdatascience.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-mlops-7d64a3e890ff
- Some good stuff, mixed with some weird attempt at combining MLOps with a business model canvas - https://ml-ops.org/

Here's a diagram that shows the relevant actions for the product recommendation engine:
