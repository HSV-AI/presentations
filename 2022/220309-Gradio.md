# Overview

https://gradio.app/

# Installation

First step is to install Gradio. Just the normal pip install will do:

```
?>pip install gradio
```

Then after that, find out that you don't have jinja2 installed, which wasn't in the install guide.

After the jinja2 installation, I was able to run the gradio examples.

Well, that was true until I got to an example that used tensorflow.

And then needed scikit-image.

And then the shap package.

# Experimentation

This is where we will walk through the examples provided by gradio, which I have split into separate files.
