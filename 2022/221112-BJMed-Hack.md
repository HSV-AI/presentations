## Discussion on "What is AI"

The traditional practice of computer programming is that you write a program that tells a computer exactly what to do. The difference with AI is that you write a program that tells a computer how to learn from data or its environment and take action based on what it has learned.

Also - you may here different terms like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, etc. Here's a good diagram that shows the relationship of these fields:

There are also two different techniques that are used with AI that you may come across:
* Supervised Learning
* Unsupervised Learning

Now that we have that basic explanation behind us, let's jump into a more detailed look at neural networks. They are the key technique that enable AI.

Moving past the smaller machine learning problems, we can take a look at a deep learning approach for image classification. This uses a ResNet34 architecture along with transfer learning to be able to classify images of cats and dogs based on their breed:
