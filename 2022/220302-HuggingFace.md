# Overview

My first exposure to Hugging Face was through a connection to the SpaCy library that I was using for NLP tokenization and chunking. At the time (2018/2019) transformers were fairly new. I should have paid more attention back then.

Most everything we're going to cover is on https://huggingface.co/

Info on the company from [crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/hugging-face/company_financials)

I REALLY like the way they have provided a view of the models based on real-life application of [tasks](https://huggingface.co/tasks)

It was also interesting that the TWIML-AI podcast this week was [Scaling BERT and GPT-3 for Financial Services with Jennifer Glore](https://twimlai.com/scaling-bert-and-gpt-3-for-financial-services-with-jennifer-glore/)

# Installation

Immediately ran into an issue trying to install pytorch. Need to find a better way to identify Python version requirements for some of these libraries. Found the answer [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
