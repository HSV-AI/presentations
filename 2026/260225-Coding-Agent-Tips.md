# AI Assisted Coding Tips & Tricks

## **1\. The 2026 Landscape: The "Agent War" (6:00 – 6:15)**

* **The "Acqui-hire" Phenomenon:** Analysis of how Big Tech is absorbing agentic startup teams to bridge the gap between models and tools.  
  * **The Cline/OpenClaw Situation:** Discussion on OpenAI’s recent talent acquisition from the Cline ecosystem and the resulting community forks (Roo Code, Kilo Code).  
* **Vibe Coding Defined:** Shifting from "syntax-first" programming to "intent-first" orchestration—using English as the primary programming language.

## **2\. The Agentic Maturity Ladder (6:15 – 6:35)**

Transitioning to AI-native development is a progression of delegated trust.

* **Level 1: The Prompt Librarian:** Managing "vaults" of frequently used snippets and system prompts to maintain consistency.  
* **Level 2: The Architect (Specs):** Moving from "chatting" to writing technical specifications. If the Spec is clear, the code is guaranteed.  
* **Level 3: The Tool-User (MCP):** Giving the AI a "body" via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to access terminal, filesystem, and web.  
* **Level 4: The Manager (Memory Bank):** Utilizing persistent state (e.g., activeContext.md) so the agent "remembers" project architecture across sessions.

## **3\. Rosetta Stone: Tool Comparison & Terminology (6:35 – 6:50)**

A breakdown of how the leading tools approach agentic behavior.

| Feature | Claude Code | Cline | Codex (OpenAI) | Cursor |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Interface** | CLI-First | VS Code Extension | CLI & API | IDE Fork (VS Code) |
| **Project Rules** | CLAUDE.md | .clinerules | CODEX.md | .cursor/rules |
| **Memory** | Auto-logged logs | Manual Memory Bank | Vector Indexing | Shadow Indexing |
| **Execution** | Task-driven loop | Plan/Act Mode | Verifying Agent | Real-time Composer |

## **4\. Community Show & Tell (6:50 – 7:20)**

* **Setup Deep Dives:** Members share their local configurations and custom .clinerules.  
* **Successes & Failures:** Real-world talk on "infinite loops," token costs, and where agents currently break down.  
* **Live Demo:** Building a functional prototype from a single **Spec** in under 5 minutes.

## **5\. Closing & Next Steps (7:20 – 7:30)**

* **Huntsville AI Updates:** Connect via the Tech 256 Discord (\#hsv-ai channel).  
* **Next Meeting:** Topic selection for March 4th.
