Here's Gemini's summary of the top 3 meetup topics:

```
1. AI Agents & Frameworks
This was the most dominant theme of the year, with deep dives into how autonomous agents work, the frameworks used to build them, and their application in engineering.

Related Meetups: Agentic AI, Agent Frameworks, OpenHands Agents, Replit AI Agent, SW Engineering with AI Agents.

2. AI for Software Development (Coding)
There was a heavy focus on using AI tools to write, debug, and optimize code. This often overlapped with the "Agents" topic but had specific sessions dedicated to developer workflows and "vibe coding."

Related Meetups: AI for Code Development, Cline – The Collaborative Coding Agent, Vibe Coding Live!, OpenHands Agents for Developing Code.

3. Creative & Generative Media
Several sessions focused on the artistic and content-creation capabilities of AI, moving from basic prompting to complex video and scientific imaging.

Related Meetups: AI for Video Generation, Midjourney – Beginner to Expert, AI in Astrophotography.
