# NVidia Certification Exams - June 25, 2025

## General Stuff

**AI Huntsville** - the next general public session will be on September 16th at 3:30. I will be doing a basic walkthrough of various AI tools and how they can be used for strategy, text, images, video, sound, etc. The overall use case will be to create and deploy a marketing campaign for an imaginary retail establishment.

**Social** - July 9th. Currently thinking of moving to Yellowhammer if I can get the private room. Could be an opportunity to sponsor.
