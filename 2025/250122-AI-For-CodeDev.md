# NVIDIA Meetup at Torch

- Trying to schedule them twice a year. Next expected in August.
- Covered some history of chip architectures
- World Foundation Models - models that know about physics. I don't know what makes them "Foundation" models.
- Using Omniverse to provide synthetic data to train models used in physical robots
- Some of the same material from their talk at the HPC Huntsville AI conference in 2023.
- NIM Blueprints? This might be useful. Think microservices applied to AI models.
- VAST- some other company pitching their product that does data stuff. Might be useful to somebody.

# Learning Quest - Intro to AI

- Over 150 people showed up. Mostly interested in the application and getting a better understanding of what AI is and what it can do. Updated presentation to cover additional years since the last time I presented this.
