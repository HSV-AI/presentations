```
Given the rapid adoption of generative AI and its potential to impact a wide range of tasks, understanding the effects of AI on the economy is one of societyâ€™s most important questions. In this work,
we take a step toward that goal by analyzing the work activities people do with AI, how successfully
and broadly those activities are done, and combine that with data on what occupations do those activities. 
```
-----------------------------
```
Additionally, we characterize the types of work activities performed most successfully, how
wage and education correlate with AI applicability, and how real-world usage compares to predictions of
occupational AI impact.
```
------------------------------------
```
To measure the potential for impact on occupations we define a holistic AI applicability score for each
occupation, where a higher score for an occupation means it is more likely to be impacted than an occupation
with a lower score. The score captures whether AI is being used (with sufficient activity share) for the work
activities of an occupation and whether that usage tends to be successful (completion rate) and cover a
moderate share of the work activity (scope), which we describe in turn.

**Notes**
- For this review, we're not going to go into the comparison to the prediction paper.
- I still don't know the difference between "coverage" and "scope"

## Background Information

- The paper covers only Microsoft Copilot
- The data is specific to US users (due to O\*NET being US focussed)


### Bureau of Labor and Statistics (BLS) Data Overview

- Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) - [https://www.bls.gov/soc/](https://www.bls.gov/soc/) 
- [SOC Structure](https://www.bls.gov/soc/2018/soc_structure_2018.pdf)
- [SOC Definitions](https://www.bls.gov/soc/2018/soc_2018_definitions.pdf)
- BLS also provided data used for number of people for each occupation, as well as wage data.


### O\*NET Overview

- Anyone have to take a caree aptitude test before?
- [https://www.onetonline.org/](https://www.onetonline.org/)
- Taxonomy - look at the paper top of page 4. It does a better job than the O*NET information
- Education Requirements are also pulled from this data
- The tasks associated with an occupation include relevance and importance metrics that are used in the paper.

## User Goals vs AI Actions

- The paper explains this best. I'm the most interested in where the AI Actions overlap with User Goals.

## Classification of chat to IWA

- Cover the LLM and evaluation technique used

## Task completion classifier

- Cover LLM and evaluation technique used

## Task Coverage Classifier

- Cover LLM and evaluation technique used

# Discussion

- Biggest takeaway for me is that this framework could likely be used for additional research for other generative models and techniques.
- Major points from the Discuss section of the paper
- Open the floor for comments and questions
