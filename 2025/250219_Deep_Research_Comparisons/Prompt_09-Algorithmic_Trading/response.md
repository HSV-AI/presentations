## Open-Source Deep Research Response

Final answer:
To address the task effectively, here is the comprehensive summary of the research findings and a structured proposal to implement a low volume algorithmic trading strategy dedicated to non-instantaneous statistical arbitrage within non-unified CEX order books alongside DEX multichain AMMs, visualized through the CPMM algorithm.
Research Summary

Strategic Focus:
Aimed at retail traders, enabling them to leverage market inefficiencies that arise due to non-instantaneous price deviations across CEX and DEX platforms.
Utilizes the Constant Product Market Maker (CPMM) algorithm prevalent in DEXs to balance liquidity and aid arbitrage opportunities.
Integrates mean reversion strategies and stochastic indicators to identify and act on viable trades, specifically in the spot market.
Methodology:
Evaluated through backtesting of historical data, the effectiveness of these strategies relies on high-quality data acquisition and real-time processing capabilities.
Infrastructure includes robust data pipelines and storage systems for effectively handling market data input and analysis.
Viability & Efficacy:
Strategies explored focus on minimizing latency effects between exchanges, ensuring real-time alignment of pricing data.
Effectiveness measured using key metrics like Sharpe ratio, win-loss ratio, and market comparative performance.
Efficacy also hinges on dynamic parameter adjustments and expanded market conditions testing.
Pseudocode Outline

Strategy Implementation Pseudocode

function Execute_Arbitrage_Strategy(cex_data, dex_data, hist_data, parameters):
db = initialize_database()
set_parameters(parameters)

    while trading_active:
        cex_prices = fetch_CEX_data()
        dex_prices = fetch_DEX_data()
        joined_prices = preprocess_and_normalize(cex_prices, dex_prices)

        for asset in selected_assets:
            arbitrage_opportunity = check_arbitrage(joined_prices[asset], parameters)

            if arbitrage_opportunity.exists:
                mean_price, stddev = analyze_mean_reversion(hist_data[asset])
                stochastic_signal = evaluate_stochastic(joined_prices[asset], parameters)

                if stochastic_signal == "buy" and arbitrage_opportunity.price < mean_price - stddev:
                    place_order("buy", asset, arbitrage_opportunity.amount)
                elif stochastic_signal == "sell" and arbitrage_opportunity.price > mean_price + stddev:
                    place_order("sell", asset, arbitrage_opportunity.amount)

                implement_risk_control(asset)

        assess_performance_and_tune_params()
        sleep(trading_interval)

Data Acquisition Pseudocode

function Setup_Data_Acquisition(api_credentials, trading_pairs, time_intervals):
db = configure_database_storage()

    for trading_platform in platforms_to_monitor:
        connect_to_platform(platform, api_credentials[platform])

        for pair in trading_pairs:
            historical_ohlcv = retrieve_historical_data(platform, pair, time_intervals)
            processed_data = clean_and_prepare(historical_ohlcv)
            db.store(pair, processed_data)

    return db

Conclusion

The proposed strategy and implementation framework offer a viable path for retail traders to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities that leverage the unique dynamics of CEX and DEX markets. By adopting sophisticated data handling procedures and refining parameter settings through backtesting, traders can enhance their market positions, optimizing for profitability in spot markets. The strategy's adaptability to various market conditions enables continuous improvements and potential for sustainable returns.
