Research prompt: how will AI shape the role of secondary school students in the classroom in the short and medium term? objective examine ai's current and emerging impacts on secondary school students’ cognitive, emotional, and social development. drawing on psychological, educational, neuroscientific, and philosophical frameworks, explore how AI tools may influence student autonomy, motivation, and well-being over the next 1–3 and 3–5 years. areas of investigation current AI integration how are AI tools presently used in secondary schools to support academic performance, engagement, and overall student experience? which studies or pilot programmes highlight the effects of ai on students’ learning processes? what initial psychological or emotional impacts—such as anxiety, motivation shifts, or self-efficacy—are emerging from regular ai use? psychological implications how do AI-driven tools influence students’ intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, autonomy, and social dynamics? How could ai enhance or impede critical thinking, creativity, and independent problem-solving skills? educational and neuroscientific considerations what evidence supports AI’s capacity to personalise instruction (e.g., adaptive learning, catering to diverse cognitive abilities)? how might AI-based methods influence long-term memory retention and overall cognitive development compared to traditional approaches? philosophical and ethical dimensions which ethical issues—privacy, bias, data security—arise from AI use in the classroom, and how might they affect students’ sense of agency? what do constructivist or behaviourist philosophies reveal about how AI could reshape students’ conceptions of knowledge and authority? how could ai impact students’ development of empathy, ethical reasoning, and responsibility? short-term and medium-term projections what technological advancements and educational strategies are likely to emerge in the next 1–3 and 3–5 years? how will student engagement, learning outcomes, and emotional responses to AI evolve as it becomes more prevalent? which policy or institutional changes are necessary to ensure beneficial, ethical, and sustainable AI integration? deliverables an evidence-based analysis of how AI currently affects secondary students’ cognition, motivation, social interactions, and emotional health a forward-looking assessment of AI’s potential to alter pedagogical methods, student experiences, and classroom environments in the short and medium term a discussion of ethical considerations, focusing on privacy, bias, and data protection a roadmap outlining strategic approaches for maximising ai’s benefits and minimising risks to students’ holistic development desired outcome by the end of this research, provide a clear, evidence-based understanding of how ai adoption in secondary education influences students—now and in the near future—and propose informed recommendations to guide educational policy, practice, and student well-being.
