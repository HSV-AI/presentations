Request:

There are countless competing AI coding agents out there now. Cline, Roo Code, Copilot (which recently added Agent mode), Cursor, Windsurf, Aider, and more. I know they hall have pros and cons, or preferences. But I need to really truly break them down into what exactly differentiates themselves from each other.

For example, the only one I know for sure is Aider. It's CLI-based (so that's a point of differentiation, if you're not comfortable using CLI). But its advantages are:

It uses less tokens on average compared to IDE plugins where you use your own API keys, due to interesting tricks with diffs, caching, compression, and intelligent prompt preparation
It's constantly "edge" with new model releases
It tends to be more precise on average in edits to code, due to its architect / edit separation.
And a con is: it's not as agentic as the others. You have to specify which files to include in its context. Though it *can* pull in other files as deemed necessary, I've found that it doesn't.

What are thoughts thus far on the web on the differentiation, or ideally decision tree, in terms of choosing one or other of the popular IDEs or plugins?
