## README

This folder contains example prompts and responses for each of the Deep Research tools. Selection of prompts were extracted from [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1ikt7ul/deep_research_dispatch_openais_answers_to_your/) and in collaboration with others in HSV.AI.

Note that all outputs are taken directly from the tool and **NO** post-processing was done. Care was taken to try to ensure each tool was covering the same type of content, but this can't be guaranteed.
