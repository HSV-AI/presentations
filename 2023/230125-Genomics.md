# AI for Genomics

## Let's ask AI to tell us about AI for Genomics:

Good morning everyone,

Today, I would like to present to you the exciting ways in which AI is being utilized in the field of genomics.

First, let's define genomics. Genomics is the study of an organism's entire genetic makeup, including the sequencing and analysis of DNA.

AI has been applied in a number of ways in genomics, including the following:

1. DNA sequencing: AI algorithms are being used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of DNA sequencing. This is particularly important in the field of personalized medicine, where rapid and accurate DNA sequencing is crucial for the development of tailored treatment plans. (Reference: "Deep Learning for Genomic Data Analysis" by J. Zhang, et al. (2017) Nature Reviews Genetics)

2. Genetic variant analysis: AI algorithms are being used to analyze large amounts of genetic data in order to identify disease-causing mutations. This is particularly important in the field of precision medicine, where the goal is to identify specific genetic variations that may be responsible for a patient's illness. A number of AI techniques have been applied in this area, including deep learning and machine learning algorithms. These techniques have been used to predict the functional impact of genetic variations, classify genetic variations as pathogenic or benign, and identify novel disease-causing mutations. (Reference: "AI in genetics and genomics: Past, present and future" by G.K. Singh, et al. (2019) Journal of Genetics)

3. Drug development: AI is being used to analyze large amounts of genetic and drug data in order to identify new drug targets and predict drug efficacy. This is particularly important in the field of precision medicine, where the goal is to develop drugs that are tailored to specific genetic variations. (Reference: "Drug discovery and development using AI" by Y. Wang, et al. (2019) Nature Reviews Drug Discovery)

4. Predictive modeling: AI is being used to develop predictive models that can be used to identify individuals at risk of developing certain diseases based on their genetic makeup. (Reference: "Deep learning in precision medicine" by Y. Wang, et al. (2018) Nature Medicine)

Overall, AI is playing an increasingly important role in genomics and is helping to drive advances in the field of personalized medicine.

Thank you for your attention and any question you may have.

## Actual attempted research

**Paywalls Everywhere**

[Deep learning in biomedicine](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4233) - Deep learning is beginning to impact biological research and biomedical applications as a result of its ability to integrate vast datasets, learn arbitrarily complex relationships and incorporate existing knowledge. Already, deep learning models can predict, with varying degrees of success, how genetic variation alters cellular processes involved in pathogenesis, which small molecules will modulate the activity of therapeutically relevant proteins, and whether radiographic images are indicative of disease. However, the flexibility of deep learning creates new challenges in guaranteeing the performance of deployed systems and in establishing trust with stakeholders, clinicians and regulators, who require a rationale for decision making. We argue that these challenges will be overcome using the same flexibility that created them; for example, by training deep models so that they can output a rationale for their predictions. Significant research in this direction will be needed to realize the full potential of deep learning in biomedicine.

**Actually Open Articles**

**Open Projects**

[DeepVariant](https://github.com/google/deepvariant) - DeepVariant is a deep learning-based variant caller that takes aligned reads (in BAM or CRAM format), produces pileup image tensors from them, classifies each tensor using a convolutional neural network, and finally reports the results in a standard VCF or gVCF file.

## Issues with AI in Genomics

Many of the same problems that plague AI in other fields are also seen when applied to genomics:

- Privacy / Data Security
- Explainability
- Bias
