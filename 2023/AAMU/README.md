## Purpose

The purpose of this talk is to give you a general overview of Artificial Intelligence, what it can and can't do, and how you can get involved.

We'll cover the types of technology that you need to learn to be productive in AI as well as the type of work available.

Discussion on "What is AI"

The traditional practice of computer programming is that you write a program that tells a computer exactly what to do. The difference with AI is that you write a program that tells a computer how to learn from data or its environment and take action based on what it has learned.

Also - you may here different terms like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, etc. Here's a good diagram that shows the relationship of these fields:

There are also two different techniques that are used with AI that you may come across:
* Supervised Learning
* Unsupervised Learning
