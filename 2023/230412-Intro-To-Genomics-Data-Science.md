# Intro to Genomics Data Science

Many of us spend the majority of our time indoors, but few of us realize the extent to which every surface we touch is home to specialized organisms that colonize those spaces — doorknobs, kitchen counters, tables, chairs, bathrooms, refrigerators, etc. When we think of different ecosystems such as deserts, rainforests, grasslands, or coral reefs, we know that different communities of organisms are specialized to live in those areas of the world. Similarly, we can infer that different compositions or groups of microorganisms and fungi may be specialized to live in different locations or surfaces around us. We call these special communities of microorganisms a Microbiome.

What if we solely knew the genetic differences between these communities of organisms? Could we perhaps reverse engineer the location of where these organisms came from? In the following tutorial, I’ll show you how we can go from genetic sequence data found in simple swabs of surfaces to differentiate between the locations of where those swabs came from (without knowing the locations beforehand) using common data science techniques.

You can either passively listen or actively join in a hands-on session with your computer where I can walk you step-by-step through the entire process of:
- Finding & downloading public genomic data sets
- Interpreting the data 
- Cleaning & preprocessing the data
- Performing common clustering & visualization techniques

I will teach you the relevant genomics - no biology background is needed :)
