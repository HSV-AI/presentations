Consider this basic conversation:

There are 3 main categories that I have been using to break this down, which you will see below. There are also some pretty big differences between the capabilities of each model. Some are pretty cool, but may be overboard for your needs or introduce unwanted risk.

Unexpected things you can do:
- Voice cloning - some of these models will take 30seconds (or more) of a voice recording and attempt to clone that voice for the output.
- Background additions - some models provide additional tokens that you can use to pause, laugh, cough, etc.
- Voice & Tone selection - Several of the models provide a way to very easily switch from male/female, upbeat/slow, 50's sci-fi announcer, etc
- Some of the latest and most realistic allow you to provide a separate prompt explaining the context and additional instructions
