# Prompt Engineering for RAG

If you have ever tried to prompt an LLM to give you what you want, you have probably run into some frustrating challenges. This can range from trying to write what you want in pseudo-code to arguing with a child about putting their toys away.

This week we will focus on some guidelines for building successful prompts for a RAG system. There is a lot of art and craft associated, and the answer to most questions is "it depends". To help understand this better, we will pull back the curtain about and talk about WHY certain prompts are effective and what types of situations they may apply to.
