        "- Natively multimodal, trained with interleaved image and text data\n",
        "- Strong performance on multimodal tasks, excels in instruction following\n",
        "- Maintains state-of-the-art performance on text-only benchmarks\n",

        "  - New 400M parameter vision encoder trained from scratch\n",
        "  - 12B parameter multimodal decoder based on Mistral Nemo\n",
        "  - Supports **variable image sizes and aspect ratios**\n",
        "  - Supports **multiple images** in the long context window of 128k tokens\n",

        "Variable image size: Pixtral is designed to optimize for both speed and performance. We trained a new vision encoder that natively supports variable image sizes:\n",
        "\n",
        "- We simply pass images through the vision encoder at their native resolution and aspect ratio, converting them into image tokens for each 16x16 patch in the image\n",
        "- These tokens are then flattened to create a sequence, with [IMG BREAK] and [IMG END] tokens added between rows and at the end of the image.\n",
