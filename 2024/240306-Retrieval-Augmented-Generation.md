# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

Initially, this sounded complicated. After looking further into it, not so much...

The initial paper on the subject was published by Facebook AI Research, University College London, and New York University. [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11401.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11401.pdf)

There's a another paper published earlier this year that provides a survey of approaches to RAG - [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10997.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10997.pdf)

For a basic understanding - this is just using the prompt as a query into a semantic search of existing material, and then using the results of the search as context provided to the LLM for generation.
