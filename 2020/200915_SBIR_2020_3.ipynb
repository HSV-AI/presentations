    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This announcement seeks proposals that offer dramatic improvements in automated object detection and annotation of massive image data sets. Imaging data is being created at an extraordinary rate from many sources, both from government assets as well as private ones. Automated methods for accurate and efficient object identification and annotation are needed to fully exploit this resource. This topic is focused on new artificial intelligence (AI) methods to effectively and efficiently solve this problem.\n",

    "### DESCRIPTION\n",
    "\n",
    "Current choke points blocking optimal exploitation of the full stream of available image data include confronting widely different views (perspective, resolution, etc.) of the same or similar objects and the overwhelming amounts of human effort required for effective processing. Current manual processes requires human eyes on every image to perform detection, identification, and annotation. Current state of the art AI requires intensive human support to generate giant training sets. Further, resulting methods frequently generate rule sets that are overly fragile in that training on one object is not transferrable to the detection of another object, even though the object might strike a human as essentially the same, and thus the need for increased human review of the algorithm decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "NGA seeks new types of AI tools optimized for the task of object identification and annotation across diverse families of image data that are reliable, robust, not dependent on extensive training demands, are applicable to objects of interest to both government and commercial concerns, and simultaneously be parsimonious with user resources in general. In particular, we seek solutions that make AI outputs both more explainable and more \"lightweight\" to human users."

    "The focus of a successful phase 1 effort should be on explaining the mathematical foundation that will enable the significantly improved AI tools described herein. Of specific interest are novel AI constructs that are more principled and universal and less ad hoc than current technology and can be used to construct a tool that performs relevant tasks. For the purposes of this announcement \"relevant tasks\" are limited to object identification across view types, drawing an object bounding box, and correctly labelling the object in a text annotation. A successful Phase 1 proposal should explain how the mathematical foundation needed to build the required tools will be developed in Phase 1 and implemented in a software toolkit in Phase 2. Examples should be developed during Phase 1 and should illustrate either improved reliability or robustness over the current state of the art, as well as reducing training demands and user resources. Proposals describing AI approaches that are demonstrably at or near the current state of the art in commercial AI performance, such as on ImageNet data sets, are specifically not of interest under this topic. The foundational element of a successful proposal under this topic is exploitation of novel mathematics that will enable new and better AI approaches.\n",

The iterative and experimental nature of SELEX makes it time consuming (weeks to months) to obtain aptamer candidates, and the overall probability of ultimately obtaining a useful aptamer is low (30%-50%). Attempts to improve the performance of the original SELEX process generally result in increased system complexity and system cost as well as increased demand on special domain expertise for their use.

The research will explore hashing/indexing techniques (such as [2]) that match information derived from media to a global reference data. The reference data is composed of digital surface models (DSMs) of known geographical regions and features that can be derived from that surface data, together with limited \"foundation data\" of the same regions consisting of map data such as might be present in Open Street Maps and landcover data (specifying regions that are fields, vegetation, urban, suburban, etc.).

The foundation features will included feature categories such as the locations of roads, rivers, and man-made objects.\n",

    "The desired output of a query is a location within meters of the ground truth location of the camera that acquired the imagery. In practice, only some of the queries will permit accurate geolocation based on the reference data, and in some cases, the output will be a candidate list of locations, such that the true location is within the top few candidates. It is reasonable to assume that there exists a reference database calculated from a global DSM with a minimum spatial resolution of 30 meters that may, in some locations, provide sub-meter spatial resolution. The foundation feature is at least as rich as that present in Open Street Maps, and can include extensive landcover data with multiple feature types. For the purpose of this topic, the reference data will not include images. Sample reference and query data representative of these assumptions, but of limited geographical areas, will be provided to successful proposers.\n",

    "Nearly every software library in the world is dependent on some other library, and the identification of security vulnerabilities on the entire corpus of these dependencies is an extremely challenging endeavor. As part of a Development, Security, and Operations (DevSecOps) process, this identification is typically accomplished using the following methods: (a) Using static code analyzers. This can be useful but is technically challenging to implement in large and complex legacy environments. They typically require setting up a build environment for each version to build call and control flow graphs, and are language-specific and thus do not work well when there are multiple versions of software using different dependency versions. (b) Using dynamic code review. This is extremely costly to implement, as it requires a complete setup of an isolated environment, including all applications and databases a project interacts with. (c) Using decompilation to perform static code analysis. This is again dependent on software version and is specific to the way machine-code is generated."

This is important because statistical significance of the evaluation results is directly tied to the size of the evaluation dataset. While significant effort has been put forth to train algorithms with low sample sizes of labelled data [1-2], open questions remain for the best representative evaluation techniques under the same constraint.\n",
