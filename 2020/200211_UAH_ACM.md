# Huntsville AI Goes to College

Welcome to Huntsville AI!

## Brief Intro

### What we do at Huntsville AI:

* Application - how to solve a problem with a technology
* Theory - for those times when knowing “How” something works is necessary
* Social / Ethics - Human / AI interaction
* Brainstorming - new uses for existing solutions
* Hands on Code - for those times when you just have to run something for yourself
* Coworking Night - maybe have combined sessions with other groups to discuss application in their focus areas
* Community - get to know others in the field. Provide talks like this one and support local tech events (HATCH, SpaceApps)
