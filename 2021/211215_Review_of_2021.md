# 2021 In Review

We made it to the end of 2021!!! Join us this week for a recap of everything (AI) that happened this year. It will be the last time we tag up this year. We will also cover changes for the upcoming year.

# Agenda


- Welcome
- 2021 Review
- Q&A
- Future Topic Discussion
- Schedule Next Meetup
- Close

# Changes for 2022

We will change our schedule slightly to align with CoWorking Night in 2022. We will be meeting in-person every other week at CoWorking Night and virtually on the alternate week. The "Hacking AI" Monday night sessions will be canceled.

# Meetup.com

The cost of Meetup.com ($200 / year) is not providing a benefit that is worthwhile. Out of 265 members, only 16 have attended more than 5 meetups in over a 2 year period. Also - there is no way to contact members in Meetup.com without using the Meetup.com messaging.

The current plan is to discontinue the Huntsville AI group on Meetup.com at the end of 2021 and move the event signup and notification over to hsv.ai

Need to check out discord. They launched events a week ago. Also provides temporary invite links for a one-time use.

# Discussion

Next year, probably need to have the yearly review as a part of the NeurIPS events.

Need to figure out how to capture the chat and add it to the presentation captured in github.

Need to learn how to do cool stuff with language models - Bug Analysis - XLNET or BERT or GPT-2 - SimpleTransformers

Need to include WandB with the product recommendation stuff

Is there an element for wordpress that will display markdown that is hosted on github.com

Maybe look at a way to hook the Deepspeech into a pipeline to provide transcript for a video feed.
