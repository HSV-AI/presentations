# NeurIPS 2021 AWS DeepRacer Challenge

This week we will cover the AWS DeepRacer Challenge for NeurIPS 2021. The AIcrowd competition provides a gym environment for DeepRacer that is free to use. During our meetup, we will clone the repository and work through the example agent provided for the competition.

For this competition, we need to train a reinforcement learning agent to drive a simulated track. It will also need to avoid other cars and obstacles placed in its path.

Even if we don't place in the competition, this should be fun and has additional benefits. You can buy an actual DeepRacer car to run your agent in real life!
