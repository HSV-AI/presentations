# Planning for NeurIPS 2021 Remote Meetup

We have a lot going on for NeurIPS during Dec 6-10, so let's get together and work through some of the details.

Also - for the DeepRacer Challenge, we are 5th on the leaderboard (simulated) and 12th (live). We will take a minute to talk about what's going on with that.

Current thoughts on NeurIPS:
1. Working with CoWorking Night to see if we can get a 2 hour slot on Dec 8th.
2. Looking at doing virtual events on Tuesday and Thursday evenings.
3. In contact with a paper author from Auburn to see if they want to present their paper to us (virtually) - https://nips.cc/Conferences/2021/Schedule?showEvent=28492
4. Already have an EventBrite event created to manage signups and such.
5. Currently thinking about this talk for streaming during the live meetup: https://nips.cc/Conferences/2021/Schedule?showEvent=22280
