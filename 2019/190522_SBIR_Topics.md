## AF192-028 EO/IR-Specific State of the Art Machine Learning

OBJECTIVE: Develop EO/IR-specific state of the art machine learning method(s) for improving utility of ISR
sensor products to provide enhanced interpretability and extend range performance over visual image assessments.

DESCRIPTION: The Sensors Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/RY) and AF Life Cycle
Management Center have been partnering on sensor technology research and development for ISR applications
covering a range of passive and active EO/IR sensor concepts. Relevant research has the potential to support the
DoD in manned and unmanned airframes. For this topic, the research should focus on the capability of performing
National Image Interpretability Rating Scale (NIIRS) 5 or better level tasks on NIIRS 4 imagery where the images
acquired are degraded due to low signal to noise ratio, atmospheric conditions, etc. These tasks are to be performed
on passive single band imagery. The rapid expansion of research in the areas of state of the art machine learning,
artificial intelligence, and deep learning open the possibility of improved image interpretability at a given imaging
range, as well as the potential for further extending range performance of EO/IR sensor systems. One major
challenge is acquiring or accurately modeling datasets for training and learning. Acquired datasets would have to be
labeled after the collection to aid with training and learning. Collection of training and learning data will be provided
by the offeror, no government facilities, equipment, etc. will be provided. An additional, but related, challenge is
that training data may only be collected over a pristine or limited set of conditions. It is important to understand how
training datasets and machine learning transfers to other data collection ranges, environmental conditions, and even
target variations. This area of research is known as transfer learning. Performance metrics will focus on
accomplishing NIIRS 5 or better tasks on NIIRS 4 imagery with 75% accuracy as a threshold and 100% accuracy as
an objective.

##  AF192-049 Data Science Based Approaches for Modeling Optimal Controls and PHM for Power and Thermal System Components.

OBJECTIVE: Develop model order reduction strategies for electrical power and thermal components that retain
high accuracy with reduced computational time for real time control and health monitoring
applications.
DESCRIPTION: Design and Verification of advanced propulsion and electric power controls requires reduced order
models (ROMs) that run in real time. Calculation of power utilization, load factors, parameter estimates, and control
mechanisms is a challenge as accurate, predictive algorithms may take an order of magnitude more time to execute
(versus clock time) to reach a stable solution. It is desirable to reduce this computational burden to allow real time
use of novel algorithms in control systems Propulsion Health Monitoring (PHM), and power and thermal
architectures. It has been demonstrated that computational statistics (CS), machine learning (ML), and related
artificial intelligence (AI) techniques that access large data sets can learn constrained domains without explicit
programming. They can capture a large percentage of the requirements for accuracy of complex component and
system loop (feedback) models of waste heat and transient power flow for electric actuation and high electric power
usage components such as diode/fiber lasers. Use of key AI techniques such as CS and ML have the potential to
reduce model/algorithm execution time by one or more orders of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art.

## AF192-057 Dynamic, Risk-Based, Situational Awareness and Response

OBJECTIVE: Develop a system for integrated threat detection, classification, and situational awareness considering
data associated with risk relative to assets, providing capability for fixed and mobile asset security leveraging all
available information.
DESCRIPTION: The USAF is tasked with securing both fixed-site facilities and mobile assets against a multiplicity
of potential threats, including conventional weapons (rockets, artillery, mortars (RAM)), and shorter-range weapons
(small arms, rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs)). Enemy use of vehicle-borne explosive devices and other
improvised weapons are also of great concern. An emerging threat to site security is the rapid proliferation of low-
cost UAS (“drones”). Weaponized drones, particularly operating in coordinated swarms, pose an immediate risk.
Their low cost and commercial availability have enabled an increasingly deadly role in theater. Other threats include
cyber-directed attacks against such infrastructure as the power grid or water supply. In some location, biological
weapons, severe weather, wildfires, civil unrest, and many others threats can also pose significant operational
hazards to secured facilities.........

This topic envisions utilization of emerging technologies in the realm of machine learning. Such systems are capable
of improving their predictive accuracy (assessment of “truth”) as they are provided with more and more data. In the
past few years, computational hardware required to utilize these tools has advanced to the point where such systems
can be deployed in tactical command centers with minimal additional facilities requirements. Some of these systems
utilize graphics processors (GPUs), which have been in wide circulation for about a decade. Additionally, new types
of processor architectures are being developed specifically for deep learning frameworks. Coinciding with the
advances in hardware, software tools are available that make development of applications readily accessible.

## DTRA192-001 Artificial Intelligence for the Testing and Analysis of Energetic Fills

OBJECTIVE: DTRA seeks an A.I. enabled operating system to be applied to energetic materials (explosives) testing
chambers for a modern, efficient, and rigorous capability to quickly and thoroughly characterize such materials and
provide a database with automated analytical capability to show, e.g., historical performance trends, performance
comparisons, variations in conditions between data points, estimate scaling performance, estimate data point error,
etc.

DESCRIPTION: The envisioned product should be able to communicate with and control a wide variety of
instrumentation and diagnostic systems such that environmental, calibration curves, and other metadata information
can be automatically logged and correlated with the data from measuring the explosive material performance. Such
instrumentation may include both analog and digital components such as thermocouples, pressure transducers,
spectrometers, cameras, oscilloscopes, etc. Data from all connected systems should be, or be able to be,
automatically correlated with time and space information. The system should be able to monitor connected systems
to allow, e.g., self-health checks or report when recalibration may be required. The developed operating system
should allow automated or user-defined sequencing and test procedures to be defined and applied. The system
should be able to provide automated analysis of tests to provide immediate feedback such as whether a test article
fell within an expected performance range or whether all instrumentation captured an event successfully.
Additionally, the system should eventually be able to suggest appropriate testing to fill in data gaps in its database
using rules such as from Design of Experiments. Modern data visualization techniques, such as virtual or
augmented reality, should be supported such that events could be replayed with data layers from non-visual sensors
available for overlay (e.g. be able to see a color layer representing pressure or temperature overlaid on a 3D movie
of the event). More-over the system should be able to apply intelligent analysis to the database developed in order
to predict baseline performance of new compounds, scaling performance of tested compounds, etc. The developed
product should not be specific to a single chamber but should instead be able to be applied to various chambers
given appropriate setup.

## DTRA192-002 Deep Reinforcement Learning Methods and Simulated Learning Environments for Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-UAS) Applications

OBJECTIVE: To develop advanced artificial intelligence (AI) for competitive offensive as well as defensive
unmanned systems to counter hostile threats that lead to degraded performance. This topic seeks development of (1)
computational methods that use a single reinforcement agent to solve complex, multi-task problems and (2)
simulated learning environments that can be used to train as well as to evaluate putative solutions.

DESCRIPTION: AI has recently been described by experts within the U.S. Department of Defense Autonomy
Community of Interest (COI) as “the next arms race”. The implications of adversarial use of AI and its successively
greater incorporation into unmanned and autonomous systems remain both unknown and a considerable source of
apprehension. Exponential growth in the C-UAS industry, for example, points to mounting concerns regarding use
of drones in civilian and military settings, and particular concern surrounds the potential for highly coordinated and
disruptive attacks mediated by groups of small (i.e., “swarming”) unmanned systems. Increased domestic and
global investment in such technologies also enhances the probability that swarming systems and other C-UAS
technologies could be exploited by the adversary to thwart U.S. military operations for which UAS are preferentially
used.

## MDA19-009 Self-Coding Cyber Fixes

OBJECTIVE: Automate fixes for cyber vulnerabilities in source code based on results from commercially available
scanning software.

DESCRIPTION: This topic seeks innovative modern methods or technologies that alleviate the burden associated
with fixing cyber vulnerabilities in already developed source code. This topic does not seek to identify the
vulnerabilities as there are many commercial-off-the-shelf tools that perform this function. A listing of such tools is
included in the references. The idea is that once scanning software has identified vulnerabilities in source code
through some sort of report, innovative algorithms based on machine learning or artificial intelligence
methodologies can take those results and automate code fixes. Proper documentation and traceability is critical to
this process as developers will need to understand what and how a cyber-vulnerability is being fixed in the source
code base. Cyber hardening code is a top priority of the Department of Defense (DoD) and such a tool would save
millions of dollars benefiting not only the DoD industry but many commercial entities as well. There are many
categories associated with cyber vulnerabilities that will need to be addressed and each category comes with its own
unique challenges in how to address them. Major categories that will need to be covered are: Buffer Overflows,
Injection Vulnerabilities, Sensitive Data Exposure, Broken Authentication and Security Misconfiguration just to
name a few. Different types of source code will also need to be addressed (i.e. C, C++, Java, Python, etc.) as well as
a discussion on how different compilers may affect the end result.

## NGA192-002 Machine Learning for Enhanced Remote Nuclear Detection

OBJECTIVE: Leverage advances in machine learning technologies and deep learning to address specific defense
challenges in nuclear security.

DESCRIPTION: Application of Machine Learning (ML) to nuclear security is a recent development.[1,2] In
particular, efforts have been directed at using ML in anomaly detection (i.e., energy spectroscopy), as well as in
nuclear material classification using spectroscopic features.[3,4] Both of these examples use supervised learning
approaches, in which a classifier is derived from training sets to accurately map future input vectors. Reinforced
learning approaches such as unsupervised methods may be applicable to distributed sensors scenarios. The main
challenge to the realization of this approach is the paucity of representative training data and the poor-quality test
cases. Novel methods in material tracking and identification are needed.[5] A hybrid approach using supervised
learning for spectral identification of a particular sensors combined with unsupervised anomaly detection of globally
distributed networks of sensors could offer a breakthrough approach to the solution of these unique challenges of
nuclear security.[6]

## NGA192-004 Simulating Coherent Activity Data

OBJECTIVE: Create high fidelity activity simulations of dynamic targets to enable training and measurable testing
of large-scale analytics and collection strategies.

DESCRIPTION: In today’s machine learning and artificial intelligence landscape, labeled data is king. In order to
augment the highly labor-intensive data labelling process, or the expensive prospect of conducting live ground-truth
experiments, there is significant research into the ability to incorporate simulated data without sacrificing robustness
[1]. While this research shows promise for static imagery, there is currently a dearth of investment in simulating
data with high fidelity dynamic targets and actors.

As ISR sensors and collection strategies incorporate machine learning and artificial intelligence in their aim to
capture fleeting targets and anticipate adversary movement, simulated dynamic scenes with accurate target
behaviors will be required for training and scoring performance not simply in static target detection and
classification, but in activity identification, modeling, and maintaining chain of custody. Characterization of
algorithms, analytics, and collection strategies in such simulated data would not only advance performance by
providing suitable training examples for machine learning approaches, but also streamline the government's ability
to benchmark, discriminate, adopt, and apply these emerging technologies.

The scale of activity relevant for most ISR systems is human actions and interactions as observed through vehicular
movement. In current modeling and simulation, a scenario of actors, times, locations, and movements is developed
through subject matter expert interviews and a painstaking manual process or through agent-based simulations of
NGA-10generalized traffic flows with software such as Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) [2] and MatSim [3]. While
these tools construct network flows in a manner sufficient for city planning or epidemiology studies, the underlying
statistics of actors transiting to and from locations are artificial and consequently insufficient for the evaluation of
ISR tracking, analytics, or collection strategies.

To achieve the required fidelity, performers would be asked to create large scale scenarios in which the underlying
statistics of simulated human mobility can be verified against open source empirical observations such as, but not
limited to, aggregated cell phone GPS, maritime AIS, Uber movement, relevant department of transportation
sensors, or even higher level data sources such as periodic news reporting of object/actor locations or documented
analytic models. The performers would not be responsible for accurate degradation of the movement data as an ISR
constellation and algorithm would sample it, but instead on the quality of the underlying behaviors and simulated
mobility patterns as measured by a statistical comparison between the empirical distributions of activities and their
simulated counterparts.

##  N192-048 Automatic Track Generation Micro Preprocessor for Dismounted Electronic Warfare

OBJECTIVE: Develop an innovative and operationally suitable solution for Electronic Warfare Systems (EWS)
Programs of Record (PORs) data pre-processing at the tactical edge that, enabled by artificial intelligence (AI) and
machine learning (ML) algorithms, must be able to process vast amounts of raw data to detect, track and recommend
actions on signals of interest in a complex electromagnetic environment.

DESCRIPTION: Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) provides dismounted EWS for geo-locating, direction
finding and countering threats on the ground and in the air. Currently these systems collect vast amounts of raw and
unfiltered data that describe signals from electromagnetic sources in the form of individual pulse descriptor words
(PDW) – potentially billions per minute. The raw data is then transmitted back to the tactical operations center
(TOC) where it is downloaded, processed and analyzed to identify objects and track targets of interest. The sheer
amount of raw data being transmitted over limited bandwidth and post-processed at the TOC is not conducive to
real-time signal of interest tracking and hinders the Marines’ ability to react to potential threats. The advent of
advanced AI and ML techniques, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and the availability of open-
source software tools (e.g., TensorFlow) and off-the-shelf processing capabilities (e.g., NVIDIA) provides
opportunity to more efficiently and effectively process electromagnetic signal data by enabling preprocessing and
filtering at the antennae sensor. The ability to detect composite tracks in real time at the tactical edge will reduce the
amount of data necessarily transmitted and post-processed at the TOC, resulting in more efficient signal analysis and
ultimately improved effectiveness of EWS capabilities....

##  N192-065 Artificially Intelligent Object with Virtual Presentation of Engineering and Logistics Data

OBJECTIVE: Develop a web-enabled object and application that encapsulates three major areas of Technical Data
(TD) into an all-in-one TD Virtual Reality (VR) structure able to quickly exhibit different views within a viewer,
based on role and responsibility; incorporated with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to capture and make predictive
maintenance analysis, detect and address anomalies, and provide a complete traceability of maintenance and part
history. An AI auto update of all related TD, as the design is improved, with the ability to identify errors within
Concurrent Engineering Logistics Layered Structure (CELLS) is desired. Develop and demonstrate a knowledge
hub for capturing and distributing the maintenance predictions and TD updates. Communication must be both visual
and verbal.

DESCRIPTION: Navy TD are currently stored in several database management systems, both in digital and paper
formats, primarily in government systems: JEDMICS (Joint Engineering Data Management Information and Control
System) and TMAPS (Technical Manual Application System). Numerous proprietary PLM (Product Lifecycle
NAVY - 54Management) systems are also utilized by engineers and contain Computer Aided Design (CAD) systems. Three
areas, all separate products, need to be incorporated into CELLS: Engineering models (a digital representation of
the engineering design with sufficient metadata to manufacture the end item, system, component, and or part) [Refs
6, 7, 8, 9]; Interactive Electronic Technical Manual Systems (IETMS) (the maintenance instructions and supply
details associated with the end item, system, component, and or part) [Refs 2, 3, 4, 5] presently NSIV (NAVAIR
Standard IETMS Viewer); and NATOPs (Naval Air Training and Operating Procedures Standardization) (the
operator instructions for Navy aviation pilots [Ref 1]). Currently the Navy pays multiple times for the same data in
multiple formats. This proposed system would eliminate that and empower our logisticians to be able to view the
needed data in real time, lowering cost and increasing efficiency...

## N192-128 Innovative Artificial Intelligence Features to Reduce Signal Dropout due to Clipping, Channel Fading, and Multi-path Interference

OBJECTIVE: Develop and demonstrate an Artificial Intelligence (AI) methodology or deep learning Digital Signal
Processing (DSP) soft/firm-ware structure for signal recognition and reception that improves the data rate
sustainable in the presence of clipping and strong fading, especially in cases where the fading has a periodic
temporal structure.

DESCRIPTION: Movement of either endpoint of a communications link or changes in the multi-path scattering by
the environment can force many mobile systems to cope with signals with strongly time dependent amplitude ("deep
fading") on time scales of microseconds to seconds. Wideband systems are often built without analog clutter-
automatic gain control and hence often experience clipping and/or small signal inadequacy. They are also especially
bothered by multi-path fading since different carrier frequencies are impacted differently by the same changes in the
reflector environment. Signal dropout within data links is thus common. Antenna diversity is often used to allow the
stronger amplitude signal to be chosen at any given time. But this patch, at a minimum, doubles the hardware costs
and has DSP back end complexity issues if the copies are not of perfectly identical quality. Additionally, it does
nothing to solve the clipping issue. The need is for a methodology to cope in the back end with signals for which the
correctness of the received data (e.g., the bit error rate) fluctuates in time. In many of these settings with longer
dropped data intervals, the signal amplitude recovers quasi-periodically; reception can restart but a new link
establishment protocol is often required to be run, lowering the time available for actual data before the next fade
happens and lowering data throughput. Layered signal reception schemes appear to be needed. One might first
process each time segment of signal of adequate amplitude to have at least a marginally acceptable bit error rate and
estimate that segment of data to produce both value and accuracy/confidence estimates as part of a probabilistic
interpretation. Once some number of intervals have been interpreted, attempts can be made to stitch together the
successive intervals, for example, by using machine learning/AI techniques to improve the understanding of each
segment by virtue of having the data available from the other time intervals. Methods could include working from
both ends of two time segments in order to build up an image of signals by concatenating more and more "on"
intervals. Consulting multiple disjointed temporal segments of the same underlying signal will allow reuse of the
already collected data and refine our knowledge of the modulation and optimize error correction, while benefiting
from a continuous time base and allowing adaptive equalization. This sort of real-time training that improves the
continuity of receptions ought to reduce the volume of redundant data transmission required. The AI methodologies
developed should be demonstrated using some form of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) processor working in real
time on a high-speed (e.g., > 20 GSps) digital data stream that represent a wide (e.g., >4 GHz) instantaneous
bandwidth and in a manner consistent with the principles of open system architectures. Approaches that can work in
dense signal environments having substantial spectral overlap between multiple simultaneous signals of
substantially different magnitude are especially desirable. Performance should be measured against the case of
stationary Rx and TX nodes and a stable communications link between them.

## N192-129 Early Detection of Information Campaigns by Adversarial State and Non-State Actors

OBJECTIVE: This SBIR topic will focus on attempts to detect hybrid, “cyborg” information actors, backing, aiding,
and amplifying human networks distributing propaganda and highly charged messages. The current state of botnet
detection merely identifies automated features such as identical content, identical targets, coordination of message
dispersal, and similar measurable enhanced capabilities; “smart” botnets that target individuals (such as super
spreaders and super friends) and topic groups are becoming more widespread and are capable of greater impact.
Sentiment models alone, and bot detection methods alone, are insufficient to detect and defend against these smart
botnets that coordinate and amplify and normalize messages of hate, anger, and violence that are typical of cyber
warfare.

DESCRIPTION: Online agitation has resulted in riots, attacks on tourists, ethnic violence, gender violence,
instigation of cyber-attacks, murder, and terrorism (see references for a small list of examples). This agitation is
aided and abetted by swarms of coordinated “bots”, “fake” accounts, and online loudspeakers of various types from
single influential individuals to platforms like Twitter, Whatsapp, blogs, and YouTube that are subject to
algorithmic manipulations, often combined with social engineering. Volatile content is combined with other types of
messaging to exploit crises and create conditions of panic, uncertainty, and hate. Military missions are increasingly
under attack by propaganda, distortion campaigns, and influence operations crafted by state and non-state actors to
undermine social trust and diminish the military’s ability to control its own messages. Further, online agitation
creates very real dangers in situations of crisis such as disasters and police actions where the military must deploy to
secure the safety of civilians. State-backed adversaries have invested in artificial intelligence (AI) and data mining
technologies to craft sophisticated “botnet armies” and other stochastic manipulations, the better to support human
propagandists and online agitators. These need to be identified and assessed for vulnerabilities and impact; guidance
for counter-measures would be the next needed step....

## N192-132 Accelerating Knowledge Acquisition for Close Combat Warriors

OBJECTIVE: To develop an adaptive training system that leverages advances in artificial intelligence and decisions
sciences, and incorporates commercially available educational technologies that align with military systems (e.g.,
Moodle), to accelerate the acquisition of knowledge and increase learning gains with a specific focus on close
combat-related tasks.

DESCRIPTION: Rote or mass learning is critical for developing foundational knowledge to support higher order
decision making. However, current military education technologies and methodologies are focused on industrial age
vs. information age methods of learning. A convergence of key enablers exists to pivot away from the mass
industrial age of training and education towards a tailored education and training approach by exploiting the
availability of ubiquitous computing, advances in machine learning, and science of learning. Furthermore,
opportunities exist that are ideal candidates for use of technologies and approaches (e.g., students awaiting the start
of a training course)...

## A19-116 Integrated 2-color thermal polarimetric sensor and deep neural network system for artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI&ML) based automatic target detection and identification

OBJECTIVE: Develop a 2-color mid and long-wave infrared (MidIR and LWIR) thermal polarimetric camera
system with incorporated artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI&ML) capability for enhanced target
detection and identification.

DESCRIPTION: During the past decade two different technological areas have advanced significantly, i.e., thermal
polarimetric camera systems and AI&ML capabilities for data analysis and exploitation. Currently, DoD spend
many tens of millions of dollars per year developing and testing thermal sensor systems designed for 24/7 day/night
surveillance capabilities for a wide variety of tactical scenarios, e.g., detection of buried landmines and IEDs,
identification of camouflaged/hidden targets, and night-time facial recognition.[1-4]
The advances in AI&ML are driven by new algorithms, notably deep neural networks (DNN), and the maturation of
graphical processing unit (GPU) technology optimized for intensive matrix computations. The latest AI&ML
algorithms can be trained relatively quickly on low cost GPUs to perform inference on GPUs in real-time. In
particular, deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have demonstrated their potential for accurate object
detection and classification. [5-8]

In order to exploit these advances in polarimetric imaging and AI&ML, we propose the development of an
“integrated” multimodal thermal imaging and data exploitation system designed to provide “real-time” scene
understanding and situational awareness. Such a system would greatly reduce the time and cost required to bring
soldier specific image based solutions to the battlefield.

## A19-125 Advanced Machine Learning Target Recognition in Munitions

OBJECTIVE: Apply Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence to target recognition algorithms in gun launched
munitions.

DESCRIPTION: The Army requires advancement in Autonomous Target Recognition (ATR) algorithms for seekers
in gun launched applications. Currently, seekers are capable of target detection in low clutter environments. To
field a fully effective weapon that is also safe for use in conditions where there is high fratricide or collateral
damage concern, the ability to discriminate between target types and between friend and foe rapidly (within
minutes) and under extremely dynamic conditions is required. This topic will apply advanced and innovative
machine learning and/or artificial intelligence to current and future target sensor packages that will be used in
artillery, tank and mortar munitions among others. This includes but is not limited to new algorithmic approaches
and/or sensor fusion approaches to improve ATR capability at extended slant ranges (3-7km), and while searching
large Field of Views (FOV) (up to 3000m radius). The ability to conduct ATR in relatively inexpensive (<$10K
unit at 1000 units/year) seeker architectures is critical. The munitions will experience high shock (up to 45,000 g’s)
throughout a range of temperature extremes (- 25 to +145 degrees F operating range). The algorithms shall be
capable of operating on emerging commercial GPU products suitable to 155mm artillery SWaP-C constraints.

**Detailed requirements will be provided after contract award.**

## A19-126 Advanced Machine Learning for Non-Destructive Testing

OBJECTIVE: Apply Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence to aid in interpretation of radiography inspection
results during non-destructive testing.

DESCRIPTION: The Army relies on radiography inspection (e.g. x-ray and neutron) for non-destructive testing of
munitions during production and special investigations. Interpreting the visual results of the inspections is a
ARMY-49challenge and requires highly trained individuals (Level III Radiographers) to determine what, if any, problems
actually exist. This topic will apply advanced and innovative machine learning and/or artificial intelligence to
current and future non-destructive radiography inspection methods that use electronic imaging to identify defects
and aid the operator in proper and timely interpretation of the results. As this technology is meant to be incorporated
in a production line, the expectation is that it will support three-dimensional inspection and interpretation of defects
at a production rate of up to 1 unit per minute, and items up to 6.5 inches in diameter. Defects include cavities,
porosity, piping, voids, gaps, low density, annular rings, cracks and inclusions ranging from 0.002" to 0.020". The
technology must reside on a standard computer system linked to the inspection equipment and receive the electronic
images from the radiography system. Specific interface requirements will be provided after contract award. This
topic will also develop and deliver the output screens that provide the proper data and information that a Level II
radiographer is trained to understand.

## A19-129 Advanced Signal Detection and Characterization Utilizing Artificial Intelligence (IL)/Machine Learning (ML)

OBJECTIVE: Design and build an electronic signal detection and characterization unit that utilizes artificial
intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), that can perform continuous monitoring of the electromagnetic
spectrum (EMS), and that can provide signal characteristics to an interface.

DESCRIPTION: Recent advances in the computing world has allowed for algorithmic advances in the detection and
characterization of the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS). Specifically, the incorporation of such things as neural
networks and training processes has elevated artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) as key
innovation areas for detecting, characterizing and cataloging highly complex signal types in the EMS. The current
effort would mature these AI/ML concepts to develop a signal detection and characterization system for electronic
signals. The unit would be able to detect and characterization various signal types and modulations. It would also
provide performance and monitoring tools to provide real-time feedback to operators. The incorporation of data
analytics for validation and visualization would be included in the unit. The system would follow a Modular, Open
Systems Approach (MOSA) to allow integration into a variety of Army systems. The MOSA approach would also
provide extensible ML and Deep Learning (DL) functions to expand upon key features and signal types. The system
would contain only Commercial, Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products.
